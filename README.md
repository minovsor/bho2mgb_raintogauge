# bho2mgb_raintogauge
QGIS Plugin - BHO2MGB grid rainfall (grid.csv) to MGB binary format (rainfall.pbi)
- Actually, I'm upgrading this plugin to a more powerful tool 'PyInterplu'
- This new tool will also include: gauge station interpolation with MGB/Interplu algorithm + simplified fill of missing data
